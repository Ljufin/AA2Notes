\paragraph{Def:} A finite extension $K$ of $F$ is a \textit{finite normal extension} of $F$ if $K$ is a separable splitting field over $F$.

\paragraph{Thm.} Let $K$ be a finite normal extension of $F$, and let $E$ be an extension of $F$, where $F \leq E \leq K \leq \bar{F}$. Then $K$ is a finite normal extension of $E$, and $G(K/E)$ is precisely the subgroup of $G(K/F)$ consisting of all automorphisms that leave $E$ fixed. Moreover, two automorphisms in $G(K/F)$ induce the same isomorphism of $E$ onto a subfield of $\bar{F}$ if and only if they are in the same left coset of $G(K/E)$ in $G(K/F)$.

\paragraph{Def:} If $K$ is a finite normal extension of a field $F$, then $G(K/F)$ is the \textit{Galois group} of $K$ over $F$.

\paragraph{Note:} Galois groups are basically groups of automorphisms on a field. They are actually very similar to permutation groups since they are groups of functions that "rearrange" a set.

\paragraph{Main Theorem of Galois Theory:} Let $K$ be a finite normal extension of a field $E$, with Galois group $G(K/F)$. For a field $E$, where $F \leq E \leq K$, let $\lambda(E)$ be the subgroup of $G(K/F)$ leaving $E$ fixed. Then $\lambda$ is a 1-1 map of the set of all such intermediate fields $E$ onto the set of all subgroups of $G(K/F)$. The following properties hold for $\lambda$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\lambda(E) = G(K/E)$
\item $E = K_{G(K/E)} = K_{\lambda(E)}$
\item For $H \leq G(K/F), \lambda(K_H) = H$
\item $[K:E] = |\lambda(E)|$ and $[E:F] = (G(K/F): \lambda(E))$, the number of left cosets of $\lambda(E)$ in $G(K/F)$.
\item $E$ is a normal extension of $F$ if and only if $\lambda(E)$ is a normal subgroup of $G(K/F)$. When $\lambda(E)$ is a normal subgroup of $G(K/F)$, then $G(E/F) \simeq G(K/F)/G(K/E)$.
\item The diagram of subgroups of $G(K/F)$ is the inverted diagram of intermediate fields of $K$ over $F$.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Def:} If $f(x) \in F[x]$ is such that every irreducible factor of $f(x)$ is separable over $F$, then the splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ over $F$ is a normal extension of $F$. The Galois group $G(K/F)$ is the \textit{group of the polynomial} $f(x)$ over $F$.

\paragraph{Thm.} Let $K$ be a finite extension of degree $n$ of a finite field $F$ of $p^r$ elements. Then $G(K/F)$ is cyclic of order $n$, and is generated by $\sigma_{p^r}$, where for $\alpha \in K$, $\sigma_{p^r}(\alpha) = \alpha^{p^r}$.
