\textbf{Section 35: Series of Groups}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Def:} A \textit{subnormal series} of a group $G$ is a finite sequence $H_0, H_1, \dots, H_n$ of subgroups of $G$ such that $H_i < H_{i+1}$ and $H_i$ is a normal subgroup of $H_{i+1}$ with $H_0 = \{e\}$ and $H_n = G$. A \textit{normal series} of $G$ is a finite sequence $H_0, H_1, \dots, H_n$ of normal subgroups of $G$ such that $H_i < H_{i+1}, H_0 = \{e\}$, and $H_n=G$.

\paragraph{Note:} The difference between a subnormal series and a normal series is that in a subnormal series the groups just have to be normal subgroups of the next group in the series, while in the normal series, every subgroup has to be normal under the original group.

\paragraph{Note:} A normal series is always subnormal, but a subnormal series is not always normal.
