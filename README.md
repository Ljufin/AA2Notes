# Abstract Algebra II Notes
This is a repository to keep track of my notes from my self-study of Abstract Algebra II.
I find that writing up what I've been learning helps me to better understand the material and also gives some proof that I've actually covered the material. The book is "A First Course In Abstract Algebra" by Fraleigh. The course covers sections 26,27,29-33,35,36,48-51,53,56.

## Material Covered by Section:

### Sec. 26: Homomorphisms and Factor Rings
### Sec. 27: Prime and Maximal Ideals
### Sec. 29: Introduction to Extension Fields
### Sec. 30: Vector Spaces
### Sec. 31: Algebraic Extensions
### Sec. 32: Geometric Constructions
### Sec. 33: Finite Fields
### Sec. 35: Series of Groups
### Sec. 36: Sylow Theorems
### Sec. 48: Automorphisms of Fields
### Sec. 49: The Isomorphism Extension Theorem
### Sec. 50: Splitting Fields
### Sec. 51: Separable Extensions
### Sec. 53: Galois Theory
### Sec. 56: Insolvability of the Quintic
